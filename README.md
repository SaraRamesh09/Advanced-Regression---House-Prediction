# Advanced-Regression---House-Prediction
Advanced Regression for house price prediction

# General Information:
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.

# Business Goal

You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.

     Ridge & Lasso Model

# Conclusion :
The optimal lambda value in case of Ridge and Lasso is as below:

Ridge - 10

Lasso - 0.0004

The Mean Squared error in case of Ridge and Lasso are:

Ridge - 0.013743

Lasso - 0.013556

The Mean Squared Error of Lasso is slightly lower than that of Ridge

Also, since Lasso helps in feature reduction, Lasso has a better edge over Ridge.
